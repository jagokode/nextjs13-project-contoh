**Hollow Knight** is a 2017 _Metroidvania_ video game developed and published by _independent developer_ Team Cherry. In the game, the player controls the Knight, a nameless _insectoid_ warrior, who explores Hallownest, a fallen kingdom plagued by a supernatural disease, known as the infection. The game is set in diverse subterranean locations, featuring friendly and hostile insectoid characters and numerous bosses. Players have the opportunity to unlock new abilities as they explore each location, along with pieces of lore and flavour text that are spread throughout the kingdom.

Hollow Knight was well received by critics, with particular praise for its music, art style, worldbuilding, atmosphere, combat and level of difficulty. By February 2019, the game had sold 2.8 million copies.[1] A sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is currently in development.
